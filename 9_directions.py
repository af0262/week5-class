# I. Can you display the driving directions?
# (hint: use the html_instructions data)

# 1. Head east on E 56th St toward S Greenwood Ave
# 2. Turn right onto S Woodlawn Ave
# 3. Turn left onto E 63rd St
#    Destination will be on the right




# II. Write a Python function to display directions
#     given any two locations.

# III. Modify the function to allow a choice between walking vs. driving.

# IV. What is the analogy between URL parameters and Python function parameters?

# V. What have you learned about best practices for inventing an algorithm?
